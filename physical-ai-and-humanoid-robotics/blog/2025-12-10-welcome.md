Welcome to our open-source book and project on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This project is dedicated to exploring the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems.

Our goal is to create a comprehensive, community-driven resource for students, researchers, and enthusiasts. The book covers a wide range of topics, from the foundational principles of kinematics and dynamics to advanced concepts in perception, navigation, and human-robot interaction.
