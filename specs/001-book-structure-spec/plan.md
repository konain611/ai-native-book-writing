# Implementation Plan: Book Structure and Content

**Branch**: `001-book-structure-spec` | **Date**: 2025-12-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-book-structure-spec/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the development process for the "Physical AI: A Hands-On Guide" book using the Docusaurus framework. It covers the project setup, content structure, technical specifications, and development phases necessary to create a comprehensive and high-quality learning resource, as detailed in the feature specification.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: `MDX (Markdown with React Components), JavaScript (ES2022)`
**Primary Dependencies**: `Docusaurus v3, React v18, Node.js v20`
**Storage**: `Git, Local Filesystem`
**Testing**: `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Automated testing strategy for code examples and content links]`
**Target Platform**: `Web (Static Site generated by Docusaurus)`
**Project Type**: `Web application`
**Performance Goals**: `p99 page load time < 1s, Lighthouse performance score > 90`
**Constraints**: `All content must be fully responsive and accessible on mobile and desktop browsers.`
**Scale/Scope**: `Approximately 6-8 chapters, totaling 20-30 lessons.`

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Accessibility First**: Content and structure must be clear, simple, and navigable.
- **II. Practical Application**: All concepts must be tied to hands-on examples.
- **III. Engaging & Visual**: The plan must account for diagrams, images, and other visual aids.
- **IV. Community-Driven**: The platform should support community interaction.
- **V. Modular & Extensible**: The content structure must be easy to maintain and expand.

**Result**: All principles are met by the proposed plan.

## Project Structure

├── research.md          # Phase 0 output
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output

└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/sp.tasks)
```

### Source Code (Docusaurus Project)

The project will follow the standard Docusaurus v3 folder structure.

```text
/
├── docusaurus.config.js # Main configuration file
├── sidebars.js          # Sidebar configuration
├── package.json
├── static/
│   └── img/             # Images and other static assets
└── docs/
    ├── part-1/
    │   ├── chapter-1.mdx
    │   └── chapter-2.mdx
    ├── part-2/
    │   ├── chapter-3.mdx
    │   └── chapter-4.mdx
    └── part-3/
        ├── chapter-5.mdx
        └── chapter-6.mdx
```

**Structure Decision**: The standard Docusaurus project structure is adopted. The `docs` directory will be organized into subdirectories for each "Part" of the book, containing the chapter files. This aligns with the modularity principle and simplifies sidebar generation.
